# react-example

This example demonstrates a simple portlet using
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), which is pulled from the NPM
registry.

It features a tic-tac-toe game as explained in [React's tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

To see this example in action you need to:

1) Configure `liferay.workspace.home.dir` in `../../gradle.properties` (set it
   to point to your Liferay Portal `bundles` directory).

2) Run `../../gradlew deploy`.

3) Add a '**Liferay NPM React Example**' portlet to your page.
