# react-example

This example demonstrates a simple portlet using
[Metal.js](http://metaljs.com/), which is pulled from the NPM registry.

It features the Metal.js tutorial as shown in its
[docs](http://metaljs.com/docs/).

---

To see this example in action you need to:

1) Configure `liferay.workspace.home.dir` in `../../gradle.properties` (set it
   to point to your Liferay Portal `bundles` directory).

2) Run `../../gradlew deploy`.

3) Add a '**Liferay NPM Metal.js Example**' portlet to your page.
